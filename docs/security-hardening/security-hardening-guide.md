# Security Hardening Guide

## 1. Operating System
- Keep the OS updated with security patches.
- Disable unnecessary services.
- Configure a host-based firewall.
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Enable automatic security updates.

## 2. Network
- Use a VPN for remote access.
- Restrict inbound and outbound traffic with firewall rules.
- Segment networks to reduce attack surface.
- Use TLS for data in transit.

## 3. Application Security
- Apply the principle of least privilege.
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Keep all dependencies updated.
- Enable application-level logging.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
- Rotate credentials regularly.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC).

## 5. Logging & Monitoring
- Enable system and application logs.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities.
- Configure alerts for security events.

## 6. Backup & Recovery
- Maintain regular backups.
- Store backups securely (encrypted, offsite).
- Test recovery procedures regularly.

## 7. Cloud-Specific Hardening
- Use identity federation for cloud access.
- Restrict IAM permissions with least privilege.
- Enable encryption for all storage and databases.
- Enable logging (CloudTrail, etc.).

## 8. Containers & Kubernetes
- Use minimal base images.
- Scan images for vulnerabilities.
- Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Restrict container privileges (no root user).
- Use network policies.

## 9. Endpoint Protection
- Install antivirus/anti-malware.
- Use disk encryption.
- Lock devices after inactivity.

## 10. Physical Security
- Restrict physical access to servers.
- Use CCTV and access control systems.
- Secure hardware disposal.
