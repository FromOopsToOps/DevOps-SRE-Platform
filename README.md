## 📌 About This Repository

This portfolio is a living demonstration of my expertise as a **Platform Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer / DevOps Specialist**, combining automation, observability, cloud infrastructure, and operational excellence.  

Here, you’ll find **production-grade** examples of:  

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform** and **Ansible**  
- **Kubernetes orchestration** (EKS, AKS, GKE) and Helm deployments  
- **CI/CD pipelines** for automated builds, testing, and deployments  
- **Observability solutions** integrating Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, and CloudWatch  
- **Security best practices** for cloud-native environments  
- **Cost optimization strategies** without sacrificing performance  

---

## 💡 Highlights

- **Multi-Cloud Ready** – AWS, Azure, and GCP configurations that are modular and reusable  
- **Disaster-Resilient Designs** – Architectures with failover, autoscaling, and zero-downtime deployments  
- **Real Incident Response Playbooks** – My approach to identifying, mitigating, and preventing outages  
- **Hands-On Problem Solving** – From “works on my machine” to “runs flawlessly in production”
